## **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced hybrid framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by integrating an external information retrieval mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically access relevant external data, improving its performance in tasks requiring factual accuracy or domain-specific knowledge.

## **Overview**
This repository explores various methods and implementations of RAG. It aims to provide insights into how external knowledge sources, such as databases or document stores, can be combined with generative models to create a more robust and informed AI system.

### **Key Features**
- **Analysis** of different RAG methods and architectures.
- **Insights** into how retrieval mechanisms work with generative AI.
- **Implementation examples** with comparative results.
